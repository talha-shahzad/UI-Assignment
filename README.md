# Responsive Web Design Project

## Project Overview

This project is a static website built with HTML and CSS, designed to match a Figma mockup precisely, pixel by pixel. The site is fully responsive, providing an optimized viewing experience across devices, including phones, tablets, and laptops.

## Features

- **Pixel-Perfect Design**: Developed by carefully comparing the layout to a Figma design, achieving high visual fidelity.
- **Fully Responsive**: Adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes, with specific layouts optimized for mobile, tablet, and laptop devices.
- **Clean HTML Structure**: Uses semantic HTML elements to enhance accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS-Only Implementation**: CSS media queries handle responsiveness without JavaScript, keeping the project lightweight and fast.

## Design & Responsiveness

The design follows a Figma mockup with the following breakpoints:

- **Mobile** (up to 480px): Optimized for small screens, with simplified navigation and a single-column layout.
- **Tablet** (481px - 768px): Adapts to medium-sized screens with a multi-column layout and resized elements.
- **Laptop/Desktop** (769px and up): Full layout with larger images, multi-column sections, and maximum detail.

## How to Test Responsiveness

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
2. Use the browserâ€™s developer tools (F12) to toggle between screen sizes or view on multiple devices to check layout consistency.
3. Verify that all elements align pixel-perfectly with the Figma design across breakpoints.

## Future Improvements

- Add animations and transitions for interactive elements.
- Integrate additional accessibility features.
